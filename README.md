# Full Stack Airbnb Clone with Next.js 13

## This project is a full stack Airbnb clone that I built from a comprehensive YouTube tutorial. By following the tutorial, I aimed to increase my familiarity and proficiency with a range of powerful technologies in web development.

## Utilizing Next.js 13, a robust React framework, I implemented a seamless client-side routing experience using the App Router feature. The frontend of the application was constructed using React and enhanced with responsive UI components from Tailwind CSS.

## To handle data management, I integrated Prisma, a versatile ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. Prisma facilitated a smooth connection to a MongoDB database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of crucial application resources such as listing data and user information.

## User authentication and authorization were implemented using NextAuth, an authentication library specifically designed for Next.js. By leveraging NextAuth, I ensured secure user sessions, managed access rights, and safeguarded user data.

## By building this project, I gained hands-on experience with the latest technologies and best practices in web development as of 2023.
